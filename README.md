# Decentralized Lottery Application

## Overview
The Decentralized Lottery Application is a blockchain-based platform that enables participants to enter lotteries in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner. Built using [Agoric](https://agoric.com/) and JavaScript, this project eliminates intermediaries, ensuring fair and tamper-proof lottery draws.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain Platform**: Agoric
- **Programming Language**: Hardened JavaScript
- **Frontend**: React.js (or your preferred framework)
- **Smart Contracts**: Agoric's Zoe framework
